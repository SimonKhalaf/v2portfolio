        <p>Hi! I'm Simon, a 22-year-old Front End Developer from Stockholm, Sweden. I love designing, coding, eating good food, and playing basketball!
        <br /><br />
        In addition to my technical skills, I am also a creative individual with an eye for design and user experience. I believe in combining technology and design to create websites that are not only functional but also beautiful and engaging.
        <br /><br />
        I mainly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for coding. I've worked on small projects to improve my skills and I work part-time as an IT manager for a sports club (<a href="https://vgbif.se/" className='vgbif'><span><ins>vgbif.se</ins></span></a>), which has provided me with a broad understanding of various aspects of technology and leadership.</p>
